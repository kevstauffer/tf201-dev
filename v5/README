hi all,
this version has big changes!
now we have 2 projects:
o kernel_chooser is a program that can boot any kernel with or without any initrd
o root_chooser is a program that can change the root filesystem on boot

root_chooser now read it's options from the kernl command line.
it looks for the newroot option and parse it as follow:
newroot=blkdev:root:init,arg1,arg2
where:
o blkdev is the device to mount
o root is the directory/dd image/initrd image in the provious device to chroot in
o init is the init program into the new root
o arg1,arg2,.. are optional args to the init program

kernel_chooser work with config files. the syntax his this:
NAME/DESCRIPTION
blkdev:kernel:initrd
CMDLINE

where:
o NAME/DESCRIPTION is an optional name for the boot entry
o blkdev is the device where he can found the next files
o kernel is the kernel zImage/uImage/Image to boot
o initrd is an optional initial ramdisk
o CMDLINE is an option cmdline for the booted kernel

if no CMDLINE is found or his length is 0 the default one wil be used.
else if CMDLINE starts with a '+' sing this will be appended to the default one
else CMDLINE will be used as commandline for the booted kernel


NOTE:
the booted kernel ( called also "guest" kernel ) must suport kexec loading.
apply these patches to your kernel:

on TF201 you must provide at at least this options for a standard kernel:
"mem=1022M@2048M mem=1022M@2048M tegra_fbmem=4098560@0xabe01000 gpt"
you can compile it into your kernel using CONFIG_CMDLINE if you wish
