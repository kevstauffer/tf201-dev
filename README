hi guys,
this is the development resource for get any linux distro works on the TF201.

since asus used andoird and the linux kernel all of her code it's under GPL v2.
thus we are free to edit and redistribush that.

in the JBkernel you can find the actual kernel that i'm using.
the JBkernel/.config.default is the deafult config from asus, while the .config is the current one.
i applied the "channel-negative-one-maxim.patch" from the aircrack-ng svn.
thus for make wardriving easier.

in the test folder you can find all my work-stuff.
it contains myinit which is the current initramfs, abootimg which is the abootimg tool.

tha folder touchpad_control contains a small program for send TOUCHPAD_ON/OFF to the asusdec ioctl.
the folder boot_chooser contains the main init program that choose what OS booting.

now i'm working on getting the elantech_touchpad working.
that is a PS2 mouse over the i2c bus.

i think that's only a Xorg-related driver/configuration setting.

i have to go now,
more update in the near future ;)
