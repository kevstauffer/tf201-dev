kernel_chooser work with config files. the syntax his this:
NAME/DESCRIPTION
blkdev:kernel:initrd
CMDLINE

where:
o NAME/DESCRIPTION is an optional name for the boot entry
o blkdev is the device where he can found the next files
o kernel is the kernel zImage/uImage/Image to boot
o initrd is an optional initial ramdisk
o CMDLINE is an option cmdline for the booted kernel

if no CMDLINE is found or his length is 0 the default one wil be used.
else if CMDLINE starts with a '+' sing this will be appended to the default one
else CMDLINE will be used as commandline for the booted kernel


NOTE:
the booted kernel ( called also "guest" kernel ) must suport kexec loading.
apply these patches to your kernel:

on TF201 you must provide at at least this options for a standard kernel:
"mem=1022M@2048M mem=1022M@2048M tegra_fbmem=4098560@0xabe01000 gpt"
you can compile it into your kernel using CONFIG_CMDLINE if you wish
