In order to change the device files, root access is required.

Bootchooser: control where the prime will reboot
 "cancel" will stop any delayed shutdown
 "shutdown", "reboot", "recovery" are all self expanitory

 anything else will be interpreted as a .boot configuration
  Simply add a file to /data/.boot.d/, following the same syntax as .boot

Backlight: get/set the display backlight brightness
 There are three ranges
  raw: 0-255 (-r)

 No parameters will output the current brightness

Touchpad: control the touchpad
 -e to enable
 -d to disable

 its that simple
