These are a collection of scrpts meant to be bound to keys (ex: for minimalistic environments)

Make sure you change the variables at the top of each file to reflect your configuration

brightness.sh:
 "i" to toggle ips
 "+" to increase
 "-" to decrase
 "=" to use saved value

 after any operation the brightness is saved in a file (keep the same brightness across reboots)

touchpad.sh:
 "on" to enable
 "off" to disable
 "toggle" to toggle
 <nothing> to use saved value
