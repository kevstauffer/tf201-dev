root_chooser it's a program that being executed as init,
read configuration from a file and choose what device we have to use as root.

the input file it's read from the device /dev/mmcblk0p8 ( DATA_DEV defined in the header file ).
that file must be named ".root" or ".root.tmp". ( ROOT_FILE defined in the header file )
in the second case the file will be removed after root_chooser read it's content.

after root_chooser successfully read the first line of the boot file, he parse it as follow:
"blkdev:root_directory_or_image:init_path init_args"
where 	blkdev is the block device to mount.
	root_directory_or_image is the directory on blkdev where your linux system lives
				or the ext4 dd image on blkdev of your linux system.
	init_path is the path to the init program ( usually /sbin/init ).
	init_args are optional args for the init program.

if no error occours root_chooser will mount blkdev on /newroot. ( NEWROOT defined in the header file )
if root_directory_or_image it's an ext4 dd image will mount it on /newrot.
change current directory and root to /newroot.
substitute himself with init_path plus init_args if given.

if an error occours root_chooser will log the error in /newroot/root_chooser.log ( LOG defined in the header file )
and will change current directory and root to /newroot,
and substitute himself with init, which is the android default init program.

this will boot up android if an error occours.
you should see a related error in the /root_chooser.log.

if in the configuration file the first character of the first line is '#'
root_chooser will remove the log file and boot up android.


*** LIMITS ***
init_args are limited to INIT_MAX_ARGS defined in the header file. ( now it's 15 )
the configuration line can be at maximum MAX_LINE defined in the header file. ( now it's 255 )
