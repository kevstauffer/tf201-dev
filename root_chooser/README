root_chooser it's a program that being executed as init,
read configuration from more files and let the user choose what is the one to use.

the input files it's read from the device /dev/mmcblk0p8 ( DATA_DEV defined in the header file ).
all files under the .root.d directory will be handled in the same way. ( DATA_DIR defined in the header file )

after root_chooser successfully read the first line of a file, he parse it as follow:
"blkdev:root_directory_or_image:init_path init_args"
where 	blkdev is the block device to mount.
	root_directory_or_image is the directory on blkdev where your linux system lives
				or the ext4 dd image on blkdev of your linux system.
	init_path is the path to the init program ( usually /sbin/init ).
	init_args are optional args for the init program.

if no error occours root_chooser will mount blkdev on /newroot. ( NEWROOT defined in the header file )
if root_directory_or_image it's an ext4 dd image will mount it on /newrot.
change current directory and root to /newroot.
substitute himself with init_path plus init_args if given.

if an error occours root_chooser will print this error to the console
and will wait until user press ENTER.
if the error is fatal root_choooser will boot up android after user hit ENTER,
otherwise root_chooser will going on.

*** LIMITS ***
init_args are limited to INIT_MAX_ARGS defined in the header file. ( now it's 15 )
the configuration line can be at maximum MAX_LINE defined in the header file. ( now it's 255 )
