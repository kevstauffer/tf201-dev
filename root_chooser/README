root_chooser is now a two part init system for the tf201:
The host kernel (the one flashed on the device), and a guest kernel.
This allows seperate kernels for android and linux.

The "host" initrd will boot on device startup.
It will wait 10 seconds for the user to press a key.
If no key is pressed, the default configuration is automatically booted.
Otherwise, a menu will be displayed with a list of configs.
Upon selection of a config, a new kernel will be called with "kexec hardboot".
If any error occurs, android will be booted.

The default configuration is /data/.root
The configuration directory is /data/.root.d
(note: /data is defined by DATA_DEV as /dev/mmcblk0p8)

The configs wil be parsed as follows:
	DESCRIPTION
	blkdev:kernel:initrd
	CMDLINE

# DESCRIPTION = an optional description
# blkdev = the device where the kernel and initrd are contained
# kernel = path to the kernel image ( uImage / zImage / Image )
# initrd = path to an initrd image
# CMDLINE = custom commandline to pass to your kernel 

if CMDLINE does not exist, it will use default values
if CMDLINE begins with a '+' the options will be appended to the default CMDLINE
otherwise the provided CMDLINE will be used.

*** LIMITS ***
init_args are limited to INIT_MAX_ARGS defined in the header file. ( now it's 15 )
the configuration line can be at maximum MAX_LINE defined in the header file. ( now it's 255 )

#########################

An optional "guest" initrd exists.
It will read the provided commandline and
mount the desired rootfs (/dev/*),
chroot into the desired folder (or .img file),
and call the new init (/sbin/init)

note: any errors here are "fatal" and will not continue into android.
It is up to the kernel and initrd to procede as it wants.
You can still hold down power to force a reboot into the original "host" kernel.

This allows multiple installations to reside in the same partition.
ex: /data/gentoo, /data/alarm, etc
